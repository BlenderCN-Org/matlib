##### for saving and loading materials #####

The interface is comprised of a button to send the current material to the current library, a menu to choose or add library paths, and a menu to choose from materials in the current library.

### User Preferences ###

Since all that fits on a single row, there is the option of where to display the row.

* Above the material selector (cycles)

* Below the material selector (cycles)

* As a standard panel.  If you intend to work with Blender Internal materials, use this option (for this version.)

Everybody is going to love the default. (Above)  I just know it.


There is also an option which allows you to have the path-selector hide *after at least one path has been added as a library.*

Tip -- Hold shift while selecting a path to open it in a file browser.
